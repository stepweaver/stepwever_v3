With more companies using AI to screen resumes, it's important to know how to make your application stand out. Nate Jones is a wealth of knowledge in everything cutting edge AI, and I'm planning to use his [The AI Resume Survival Guide](https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/the-ai-resume-survival-guide-for?r=5489h6&utm_medium=ios) to update my own resume.

Nate Jones is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to using AI. I need to update my resume and I intend to use his guide to do it.

## The Resume Reset

Here's what I did:

- I ran my resume through ChatGPT along with Nate's guide.
- I asked it to compare and rewrite my resume based on the principles in the article.
- It suggested switching to a single-column layout and adding an **AI Technologies & Prompt Engineering** section.
- Then, I gave it _my real story_ - how I've used AI to build my projects, debug my code, and accelerate my learning.

That made the difference. The tone shifted from _"I know these tools"_ to:

> _"Here's how I use them to get results."_

Supposedly, my resume is now fine-tuned for ATS filters. We'll see if it works, eh?

If you're reading this post and found it through my resume - please tell me! I'd be THRILLED.

I'll continue to use AI to refine and tweak my resume in the coming weeks - because I'm actively looking for work. You can check back from time to time to see what's changed. Or you could just **[hire me](https://stepweaver.dev/about)** and skip the suspense.
