I've always been fascinated by terminal-based tools that boost productivity without leaving the command line. For my next project, I'm creating a sleek, functional calculator that runs directly in my terminal environment.

## Project Vision

- Design a calculator with a clean TUI (Text User Interface) using ASCII art
- Support standard arithmetic operations, memory functions, and scientific calculations
- Include keyboard shortcuts for quick calculations without using the mouse
- Add color-coding and visual feedback for better user experience
- Make it easily accessible as a command anywhere in my terminal

This project combines my love for efficient tools with the satisfaction of building something practical. Stay tuned for progress updates!
