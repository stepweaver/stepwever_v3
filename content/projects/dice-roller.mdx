My buddy and I are about to start playing Ironsworn: Starforged, a sci-fi tabletop RPG. While you can play with physical dice or another online dice roller, I thought it would be cool to build a simple dice rolling app-and even better, integrate it with my terminal!

It’s a great excuse to practice coding and learn new things.

## BRAINSTORM!

- A simple app that can roll different types of dice (like d6, d10, etc.).
- A way to use it from my terminal, because why not!?

Stay tuned for updates as I build this out! If you have tips or want to collaborate, let me know.
