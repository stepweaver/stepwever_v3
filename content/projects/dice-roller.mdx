My buddy and I are about to start playing Ironsworn: Starforged, a sci-fi tabletop RPG. While you can play with physical dice or another online dice roller, I thought it would be cool to build a simple dice rolling app-and even better, integrate it with my terminal!

It's a great excuse to practice coding and learn new things.

## BRAINSTORM!

- A simple app that can roll different types of dice (like d6, d10, etc.).
- A way to use it from my terminal, because why not!?

Stay tuned for updates as I build this out! If you have tips or want to collaborate, let me know.

## IT'S ALIVE!

The dice roller is complete and honestly, it turned out way cooler than I originally planned!

**What I built:**

- **Full dice suite** - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100 in a hexagonal layout (with the d20 right in the center where it belongs!)
- **Dice pool system** - Add multiple dice types, adjust quantities on the fly
- **Modifiers** - Because what's a D&D roll without a +5 to hit?
- **Roll notes** - Tag your rolls with comments like "Initiative" or "Sneak attack"
- **Roll history** - Every roll is saved locally so you can track your session
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Enter to roll, C to copy, R to reset, ESC to clear (terminal vibes!)
- **Visual animations** - Dice spin and bounce when rolling
- **Copy notation** - One click to copy the dice notation for sharing

The whole thing has a retro terminal aesthetic with glowing borders and that satisfying green-on-black color scheme. It's fully responsive too, so it works great on mobile during game sessions.

## What's Next?

Now that I've got the core dice mechanics down, I'm wondering... could I build a full Yahtzee game? 🤔 The dice logic is already there, I'd just need to add scoring rules and game state management. Might be a fun next challenge!
