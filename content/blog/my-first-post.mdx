# Welcome to Î»stepweaver!

Why this site?

This site is for me-to be intentional about organizing my thoughts on web development and to build in public.

I want to say thank you to [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co). I discovered her site through ChatGPT and used it as the inspiration for my site (more on that later).

I don't know how much I'll post, but I'm excited to have a space to share and grow.

<Update />

It's been a few weeks since I started this blog, and I'm learning a lot! I've implemented a new "living post" feature that allows me to update posts and have them show up in the latest updates feed on the home and codex pages.

This way, posts can evolve over time rather than being static snapshots. I think this approach better reflects how my projects and thoughts develop.
