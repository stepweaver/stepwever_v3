# The Job Hunt Begins: Two Days In, Here's Where We Stand

I'm officially on the hunt, and I'm bringing you along this wild, challenging, and exhilarating ride. Tell your friends! Share my site!

These last two days have been a whirlwind — fueled by equal parts hope, determination, and yes, a little bit of adrenaline. There's a fire inside me, pushing me forward, reminding me that this is my time to level up, break barriers, and find the place where I can truly make an impact.

So, what have we done so far? In these first two days, I've submitted 6 applications across a diverse range of roles:

- 2 positions in AI & Developer Tools
- 1 role in Infrastructure & Platform Engineering
- 1 opportunity in E-commerce
- 3 positions in Technical Business Analysis & Software Engineering

Each of these roles represents a different facet of my interests and skills:

## AI & Developer Tools

Working where the future of AI-driven development is being shaped? Count me in. I'm ready to bring my coding skills and hunger to learn to the table, helping build the next generation of developer tools.

## Infrastructure & Platform Engineering

Diving deep into infrastructure and runtime environments is exactly the kind of challenge that gets me fired up. I want to build scalable systems that empower developers worldwide.

## E-commerce & Digital Platforms

Joining a company that's transforming how businesses operate in the digital age. I'm excited about the opportunity to work on platforms that empower entrepreneurs and businesses.

## Technical Business Analysis & Software Engineering

This blend of roles represents my sweet spot — where technical expertise meets business acumen. Whether it's building solutions that improve user experiences or helping translate business needs into technical solutions, I'm ready to make an impact.

## Why am I sharing all this?

Because this is just the beginning. I want you to see the hustle, the resilience, and what it takes to find a job in today's tech world. I'm not just applying to jobs — I'm launching a mission to find my next big opportunity, and I want you there for every triumph and every lesson.

So buckle up. Over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing updates, interview prep notes, wins, and yes — even the inevitable setbacks. This journey is real, it's gritty, and it's one I'm ready to own.

Here's to chasing the future!

# Update: Day Seven

The job hunt is in full swing! Since my last update, I've sent out 24 more applications. Here's the breakdown:

- 16 Business Analyst roles
- 4 Tableau or BI Developer positions (that perfect blend of Business Analyst and Web Developer that feels like my sweet spot)
- 1 part-time opportunity
- 3 Software Engineer roles

What I'm noticing? Companies are hungry for data visualization and custom data pipelines—tools that empower teams to make data-informed decisions. That's exactly my wheelhouse, and it's energizing to see so many roles that align with what I do best.

I'm not just relying on online applications, either. I reached out to an old colleague and a relative (who has a network that could open some doors) and sent them my resume. I even suited up and hand-delivered a printed copy to a local company I'd applied to—though, in true 2025 fashion, they wouldn't accept it. Everything's online now, and that's just the way it is.

That's why I have zero shame in using AI to supercharge my job search. After creating 24 versions of my resume, I fed them all back through AI and built a MASTER resume. Now, every time I apply, I use ChatGPT to tailor my resume to the specific posting—leveraging all the insights from my ongoing conversations about my experience and skills.

Seriously, if you haven't run your resume through AI for a week, you're missing out. It's a game-changer.

Yes, the em-dashes! You may be able to tell that I wrote this with AI, but here's the thing—I first wrote about 90% of it myself, just not so eloquently, into the chat editor. The AI simply made what I wanted to say coherent.

But here's the kicker: there are companies out there actively looking for people who know how to use AI tools. THAT'S THE POINT! It took me about 10 minutes to write this update today, and that's a skill in itself.
