# I Built the COOLEST AI Resume! (And It Actually Talks Back)
I think I built the coolest resume that can exist in today’s AI-driven world, and I’m genuinely excited about it.

Instead of a static PDF sitting on a page, my resume now lives inside an AI chat widget and my interactive terminal.

Meet Lambda, an AI advocate trained on my resume, experience, and work. You can ask it about my background, skills, projects, or how I think about technology, and it answers on my behalf.

You can try it here:

It also fits how I actually work: terminals, systems, automation, and letting machines handle the boring parts so humans can focus on judgment and creativity.

This is very much an experiment, but it’s one I’m proud of. More to come.
