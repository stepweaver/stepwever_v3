This is the coolest type of resume you can have these days.

Instead of a static PDF sitting on a page, my resume now lives inside an AI chat widget and my interactive terminal. You can converse with it.

Meet λlambda, an AI advocate trained on my resume, experience, and work. You can ask it about my background, skills, projects, or how I think about technology, and it answers on my behalf.

Just click the widget in the bottom corner of the screen and ask a question. Or, you can even chat with it in my [interactive terminal](https://stepweaver.dev/terminal)! Just type `chat <message>`. How cool is that!?

This is very much an experiment, but it’s one I’m proud of. More to come!
