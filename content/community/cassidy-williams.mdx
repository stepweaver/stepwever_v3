### Cassidy Williams' website inspired this portfolio.

I was stuck in tutorial hell and needed a way out. I was blindly copying code and
knew that I needed to make something original-not just some cookie-cutter YouTube
portfolio. I had heard mimicry is a good way to learn, and while I was learning,
I just needed to wrap my head around the build process in my own sort of way (but
we won't talk about how many times I rebuilt this site... **sneaking scope is a bitch!**).

So I asked ChatGPT to show me some well-known developer portfolios with monospaced
fonts, and Cassidy's site stood out right away. I loved the simple layout and the
clean, friendly style.

But as I looked around, I realized Cassidy is more than just a good designer-she's
really active in the developer community, shares tons of resources and tips, works
at GitHub, and her blog posts are genuinely fun to read.

Thanks, Cassidy!
